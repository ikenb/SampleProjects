    /// INSTRUCTIONS:
    /// Write the logic within the Anagram Service class to determine how many anagrams exist in a given list of words.
    /// The definition of an anagram can be found here: https://www.google.co.za/?#q=definition+of+anagram
    /// 
    /// The output should list how many anagrams exist for a given character count.
    /// E.g. Words with the character length of 4 had 5000 anagrams  
    /// 
    /// Feel free to change the structure of the solution if you feel it helps optimise execution speed, memory usage etc.
    /// Feel free to ask other colleagues and / or use google when crafting your solution.
    /// Document assumptions (if any) as comments in code.
    /// 
    /// Your code should:
    ///     a) make use of the included file Dictionary.txt, 
    ///     b) write your results to the console in the form "Words with the character length of x had y anagrams"
    ///     c) include the total time in milliseconds somewhere in your console output
    ///     d) not write to the console on processing each word
    /// 
    /// Should BSG proceed with a follow-up interview, you will be required to walk through your code as part of the face to face interview process. 
    /// 
    /// Press return the completed solution with 48 hours to BSG, using the same email address that you received the zipped package.
    /// Please re-zip your solution excluding all unnecessary files (e.g. *.user, *.suo, bin folder, obj folder)
